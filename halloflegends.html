                  <p class="facts">Facts: Sarda is yet another prime example for a player who joined to prove herself
                    and
                    demonstrate that
                    she can compete on a cutting edge team, she was a part of team Nephilims back in 9.0; further on she
                    continued to develop and work on her leadership skills and managed to become a part of the
                    Leadership team
                    for team frost and heavily contributing to the team's success along with the other leaders on the
                    team.</p>
                  <p class="notes">Notes: Sarda has a great confidence in herself and her team, she may sound bossy at
                    times,
                    and
                    interrupting her during communication could prove as difficult as trying to get a mythic boss down,
                    but
                    eventually everyone gets to see past that to see the great side of her personality and great
                    commitment
                    and loyalty she has towards Nephilims and her team.
